### **Causal Inference with Experimental Data: Reddit Gold & Balsakhi Program Analysis**

---

### üìù Project Description:

This repository contains R-based causal inference analyses using experimental data from two real-world case studies:

1. **Reddit Gold Experiment**: Investigates whether awarding Reddit Gold incentivizes users to generate more content. The analysis explores treatment effects on posting behavior using linear regression and subgroup analysis, while assessing the plausibility of the SUTVA assumption.

2. **Balsakhi Education Program**: Evaluates the impact of supplemental tutoring for underperforming primary school students in India. Using pre-post test score comparisons and t-tests, we assess the effectiveness of the intervention in improving academic outcomes in math and language.

Each analysis includes:

* Data cleaning and exploration
* Statistical testing and regression modeling
* Discussion on randomization and causal assumptions (e.g., SUTVA)
* Reproducible R Markdown reports
